# Fine-Tuning Plan for Llama-3-8B-Instruct LLM

---

## 1. Setup

In my implementation of the fine-tuning, I extensively leveraged the Hugging Face ecosystem. With the goal of maximising efficiency and ease of use, the set-up includes foundational Hugging Face APIs like **AutoModelForCausalLM** to load Llama-3-8B-Instruct, **AutoTokenizer** for text encoding/decoding, and **TrainingArguments/Trainer** abstractions for managing training loops.  

I went with **BitsAndBytes** as it is a core foundation of quantisation. This enabled the 8-billion Llama model to be shrunk to fit a single 24–48 GB GPU without a dramatic fall in performance.  
Specifically, using BitsAndBytes config parameters like `load_in_4bit=True`, `bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"`, `bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True` … ensures that model weights are stored in 4-bit (particularly the NF4 format), while computations still happen in 16-bit or higher.  

The University of Washington researchers in their groundbreaking paper discovered that such `bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True` saves averagely 0.37 bits per parameter, resulting in substantial to significant memory savings in large models.  

Traditionally, on a single GPU, it would be near impossible to rapidly fine-tune an 8 B llama model, hence my adoption of **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, which Meta introduced.  

PEFT—particularly through the introduction of **Low Rank Adapters (LoRA)**—introduces game-changing reduction in the computation demands of fine-tuning LLMs as small, trainable low-rank matrices can be injected into the frozen, quantised model. According to a paper by Edward J. Hu et al, LoRA remarkably slashes training memory and parameters by up to **10 000×** and reduces GPU memory by **3×** while maintaining model quality!  

In my fine-tuning implementation, for the **LoraConfig**, I went with a **Lora rank of 16**, targeting the query, key, value, and output projections for the low-rank adapter injection.  
Also, to enhance development speed and training standardisation, I wrapped the transformer training loop in **TRL’s SFTTrainer**, wiring up the HF, tokenizer, dataset, LoRA, and quantisation under the hood without introducing elaborate glue code.

## 2. Technique: QLoRA Rationale

QLoRA was a transformative innovation in the fine-tuning universe, thanks to its unique combination of **4-bit model quantisation** and **LoRA adapters**. This means just anyone can reasonably fine-tune a large model on modest hardware.  

The 4-bit quantisation basically involves transforming weights to a 4-bit representation (specifically NF4, or “NormalFloat 4”). Researchers found that this cuts memory usage by **75–80%**. Double quantisation further compresses quantisation constants with negligible accuracy loss. Compute happens in **bfloat16**, preserving numerical stability and speed.  
According to Dettmers et al. (2023), research conducted on fine-tuning a 65 B model on a single 48 GB GPU within one day incredibly leapt to **99.3%** of ChatGPT’s performance!  
With QLoRA, my Llama fine-tuning enjoyed faster convergence, without losing performance while avoiding the infamous hurdle of **“catastrophic forgetting”** that fine-tuning sometimes introduces.

## 3. Hyperparameters: Balancing Capacity, Stability, and Speed

Next, I detail my choice of hyperparameters for the fine-tuning implementation.

| Parameter                       | Value                             | Rationale                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LoRA Rank (r)**               | 16                                | Strikes a balance of expressiveness vs. adapter size (8–32 range in LoRA literature)     |
| **LoRA Alpha (α)**              | 32                                | 2× r scaling stabilises adapter update magnitudes                                         |
| **LoRA Dropout**                | 0.05                              | Slight regularisation to curb overfitting on small, domain-specific data                  |
| **Optimizer**                   | Paged AdamW 8-bit (bitsandbytes)  | Pages optimizer states to CPU when needed, saving precious VRAM                           |
| **Learning Rate**               | 2 × 10⁻⁴                          | Higher LR for adapter-only training; 3% warm-up to avoid initial spike                    |
| **Batch Size**                  | 4 per GPU + grad-accum → 16       | Simulates a larger batch for smoother training without blowing GPU memory                |
| **Epochs**                      | 3                                 | Sufficient to converge on our small marketing dataset; watch for overfitting              |
| **Max Sequence Length**         | 1 024 tokens                      | Covers full instruction + context + response chains without truncation                   |
| **Gradient Checkpointing**      | Enabled                           | Trades extra compute for large memory savings                                             |
| **Max Gradient Norm**           | 0.3                               | Clips gradients to prevent explosion with quantised weights                               |

These hyperparameters prioritise memory savings and training stability, while giving the model enough capacity to master our marketing re-expression task.

## 4. Evaluation Strategy: Beyond Loss Curves

To gauge real-world effectiveness, I would suggest a nuanced combo of qualitative and comparative assessments:

- **Validation-Set Metrics**  
  - **BLEU/ROUGE**: N-gram overlap against reference responses, offering rough fidelity signals.  
  - **BERTScore** or **Embedding-Similarity**: Captures semantic alignment, especially useful when wording can legitimately vary.  
  - **Perplexity**: Lower perplexity on held-out data indicates the model predicts domain-specific re-expressions well.

- **Human & Expert Review**  
  - Sample **50–100** re-expressions for marketing experts or content writers to rate on:  
    - **Accuracy/Faithfulness**: Does it preserve original meaning?  
    - **Clarity & Tone**: Is the style on-brand and persuasive?  
    - **Fluency & Grammar**: Are there any language errors or awkward phrasings?

- **Automated “Judge” with a Stronger Model**  

  - Llama 3 is fantastic, but its performance pales beside ChatGPT 4. We could deploy a stronger model like GPT-4 via API as an automated evaluator.  
  - Such a senior model would be saddled with automatically scoring or critiquing outputs on content accuracy, persuasiveness, and style. This approach, used in recent LLM evaluation studies, provides rapid, large-scale feedback on output quality, especially when we don’t have the privilege of full human annotation.
